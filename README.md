# Material-UI pickers

Fork of material-ui pickers starting from 4.0 alpha 10. This version has the range picker and still works with Material-UI v4.1.11 (latest stable).

Cypress tests are stripped due to difficulty behind a corporate firewall and some development environment setup with WSL2.

CI was changed to GitHub actions and packge is hosted on github package registry.
